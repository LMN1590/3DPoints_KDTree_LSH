# KD-Tree and Hash
Question: In this topic, you will learn about Kd-Tree, an advanced data structure that supports searching multidimensional data. You will have to implement a simple Kd-Tree. To assess the quality, you will use the Point3D data structure { float x, y, z; } and randomly-generated points in 3D space, values of each dimension in range of 0-100. The accuracy of each point is 0.001. Furthermore, you can also use a hash algorithm to hash a coordinate into bins (size can be chosen by yourself, for example 0.1). Let's compare the performance of Kd-Tree vs using hashing with different number of points. As the number of points increases, which solution is better, analyze and give proof.

Requirements: You will have to write a report about your finding in this project. Submit a .zip file containing your report and implementation code.
