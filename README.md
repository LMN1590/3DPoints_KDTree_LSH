# KD-Tree and Hash
Question: In this topic, you will learn about Kd-Tree, an advanced data structure that supports searching multidimensional data. You will have to implement a simple Kd-Tree. To assess the quality, you will use the Point3D data structure { float x, y, z; } and randomly generate points in 3D space, values of each dimension in range of 0-100. Accuracy of each point is 0.001. With searching for a point in this space, you can use a hash algorithm to hash a coordinate into bins (size can be chosen by yourself, for example 0.1). Let's compare the performance of KdTree vs using hashing with different number of points. As the number of points increases, which solution is better, analyze and give proof.

Requirements: you make a simple report of the requirements in the description of the essay. Submit a .zip file containing your report and implementation code.

I wish you all the best in completing your essay and learning new knowledge.
